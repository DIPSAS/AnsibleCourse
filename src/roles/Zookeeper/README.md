zookeeper_dir: /opt/zookeeper-{{zookeeper_version}} # or /usr/share/zookeeper when zookeeper_debian_apt_install is true
zookeeper_conf_dir: {{zookeeper_dir}} # or /etc/zookeeper when zookeeper_debian_apt_install is true
zookeeper_tarball_dir: /opt/src

# List of dict (i.e. {zookeeper_hosts:[{host:,id:},{host:,id:},...]})
zookeeper_hosts:
  - host: "{{inventory_hostname}}" # the machine running

Example Playbook
----------------

```yaml
- name: Installing ZooKeeper
  hosts: all
  sudo: yes
  roles:
    - role: AnsibleShipyard.ansible-zookeeper
```

Cluster Example
----------------

```yaml
- name: Zookeeper cluster setup
  hosts: zookeepers
  sudo: yes
  roles:
    - role: AnsibleShipyard.ansible-zookeeper
      zookeeper_hosts: "{{groups['zookeepers']}}"
```

Assuming ```zookeepers``` is a [hosts group](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_inventory.html#group-variables) defined in inventory file.

```inventory
[zookeepers]
server[1:3]
```

Custom IP per host group

```
zookeeper_hosts: "
    {%- set ips = [] %}
    {%- for host in groups['zookeepers'] %}
    {{- ips.append(dict(id=loop.index, host=host, ip=hostvars[host]['ansible_default_ipv4'].address)) }}
    {%- endfor %}
    {{- ips -}}"
```

See this sample [playbook](https://github.com/AnsibleShipyard/ansible-galaxy-roles/blob/master/playbook.yml)
which shows how to use this playbook as well as others. It is part of [ansible-galaxy-roles](https://github.com/AnsibleShipyard/ansible-galaxy-roles) and
serves as a curation (and thus an example) of all our ansible playbooks.
